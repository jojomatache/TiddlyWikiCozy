description: Render an individual tiddler as a specified ContentType

Render an individual tiddler as a specified ContentType, defaulting to `text/html` and save it to the specified filename. Optionally a template can be specified, in which case the template tiddler is rendered with the "currentTiddler" variable set to the tiddler that is being rendered (the first parameter value).

```
--rendertiddler <title> <filename> [<type>] [<template>]
```

By default, the filename is resolved relative to the `output` subdirectory of the edition directory. The `--output` command can be used to direct output to a different directory.

Any missing directories in the path to the filename are automatically created.
