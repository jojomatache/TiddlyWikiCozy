title: Hook: th-opening-default-tiddlers-list
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This hook allows plugins to add to or remove from the list of tiddlers that are opened when the wiki is first loaded or the home button is clicked.

The function takes a list of tiddlers as its only argument and returns a modified list of tiddler titles to display.

Note that this hook is invoked with the tiddler titles that are generated from the filter in [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]]. Any added entries must be tiddler titles, not filter expressions.
