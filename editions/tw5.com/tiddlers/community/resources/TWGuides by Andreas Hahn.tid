A collection of community tips and tutorials curated by Andreas Hahn, including a handy "customiser" that simplifies creating an empty TiddlyWiki with selected plugins and enhancements.

Updated to include [[Tinka|http://twguides.org/tinka.html]], a plugin that "provides a GUI to create and modify plugins more easily, therefore saving time on the packaging process".

The intent of the project is to encourage people to use and actively tweak TiddlyWiki according to their needs. Similar to the old version, I also want to encourage people to share their knowledge and help other people get the most out of this wonderful piece of wiki software.
