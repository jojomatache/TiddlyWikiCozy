type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

By default, TiddlyWiki saves changes on InternetExplorer 10 and above using a saver module that downloads the newly modified file, rather than saving it directly. There are two alternatives that both save changes directly to the file:

* [[Use the TiddlyIE browser extension|Saving with TiddlyIE]]
* Use the [[Windows HTA Hack]] by renaming the TiddlyWiki HTML file to have the extension `*.hta`.
